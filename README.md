# FCMClustering
A Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) Clustering modest class 
## About
This project is a C++ class that can generate a Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) model 
with various parameters defined by the user, the parameters include 
n_cluster, max_iter, min_error & power.
To build the model use the build method which is fit with X input.
So that the final result of the model is a tendency for each data to enter its cluster 
in the form of an encoded U matrix (One-Hot).
